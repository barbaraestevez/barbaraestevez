### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
##My name is BÃ¡rbara EstÃ©vez.

I'm a Frontend Web Developer & Graphic Designer.

After having developed my professional career around graphic design and editorial layout I wanted to renew myself and dedicate myself to frontend web development. Methodical and detail-oriented, I would like to have the opportunity to develop my knowledge in a real work environment, continue learning and consolidate knowledge that will help me in my new future as a programmer.
